# UnnecessaryProgramKiller
A program that shuts down all programs and services that we do not use with a single keystroke at computer startup or after.

Running the "Program Killer Setup.msi" file is sufficient for installation.

> At first boot, it asks your e-mail address for a one-time. Once you have verified this e-mail address, you can enjoy all the features of the program completely free of charge forever.
